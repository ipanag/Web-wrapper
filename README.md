Web-wrapper
===========

The main purpose of this tool is to help HTML developers to build a proper web site that works as expected inside a WebView component in a native application. Usually testing on a mobile browser doesn't have the exact same behavior as the WebView, causing difficulties when HTML developers and Android developers have to work together in a hybrid (native and web) application.
